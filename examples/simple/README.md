# Simple Example

This demonstrates a simple Eta project with an application and a test.

## Running the example

```
$ ./gradlew run
```

## Running the test

There is also a test in this project which uses the `useEtaTest()` method to tell Gradle to simply check whether the test application runs successfully or not.

```
$ ./gradlew test
```
